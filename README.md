# Alfred Bluetooth Workflow

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

[Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to quickly connect / disconnect Bluetooth devices.

## Installation

Simply download the latest [`Bluetooth Connector.alfredworkflow`](https://github.com/tilmanginzel/alfred-bluetooth-workflow/releases)
 release and double-click to import into Alfred. 

Note regarding macOS 14 (Sonoma): Starting with Sonoma, it is necessary to give Alfred bluetooth access. It can be done by navigating to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Bluetooth and adding Alfred to the list of apps by clicking the plus icon and choosing Alfred.

Note regarding macOS 10.15 (Catalina): Since MacOS 10.15, [Notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution) is required for apps.
As this workflow and its distributed binaries are not notarized, please try the following workaround:

- Install an [old version](https://github.com/tilmanginzel/alfred-bluetooth-workflow/releases/download/v0.4.0/Bluetooth.Connector.alfredworkflow) of the workflow
- Update via `blt workflow:update`

See [#9](https://github.com/tilmanginzel/alfred-bluetooth-workflow/issues/9) for more information and other possible [workarounds](https://github.com/tilmanginzel/alfred-bluetooth-workflow/issues/9#issuecomment-539647706).
